# Rock Paper Scissor

Rock paper scissor is a hand game, usually played between two players. In this game, each player simultaeously forms one of three shapes with their hands.

So I have implemented this small game with a python program, here a single user can play this cute little games with his own computer/laptop machine.

## How this works?
